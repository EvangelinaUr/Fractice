<h3>Use SSE2</h3>

<p>This option controls whether SSE2 instructions are used instead of FPU (Floating-Point Unit) instructions. SSE2 is normally significantly faster, so this option is enabled by default. SSE2 is currently implemented for the Mandelbrot set only, and only for the classic set, not the <a href="../Parameters/Exponent.htm">higher-exponent</a> variants. Note that this option has no effect on <a href="../Parameters/Deep_Zoom.htm">deep zoom</a> renders, which are handled differently.
