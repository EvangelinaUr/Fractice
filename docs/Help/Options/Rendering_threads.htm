<h3>Rendering threads</h3>

<p>This option allows you to set number of rendering threads. The thread count defaults to the number of CPUs reported by Windows. This is typically optimal, but reducing the thread count could potentially improve performance on a Hyper-Threading processor.

<p>Note that in a <a href="../Distributed_processing/Distributed_processing.htm">distributed processing</a> environment, this option only affects the client; to set the number of rendering threads for a server, use the server's <tt>/threads</tt> <a href="../Distributed_processing/Server_arguments.htm">command-line argument</a>.
