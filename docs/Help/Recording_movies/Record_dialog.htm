<h3>Record dialog</h3>

<dl>
<dt>Duration
<dd>The duration of the <a href="../Recording_movies/Recording.htm">movie</a>. This can be entered in either time (hh:mm:ss) or frames. Use the Time/Frames radio buttons to select the desired unit.
<dt>Frame Rate
<dd>The movie's frame rate, in frames per second. Fractional values are permitted. Common values are 29.97 for NTSC, and 25.00 for PAL.
<dt>Parameters
<dd>This grid control allows you to override any of the <a href="../Parameters/Parameters.htm">parameters</a>. To change a parameter, left-click it, enter a new value, and press <span class="key">Enter</span>.
<dt>Frame Range
<dd>To record only a subset of the movie, select "Range" and enter the desired frame range.
<dt>Record to bitmaps
<dd>Check this box to record the movie as a sequence of numbered bitmaps instead of an AVI file. This is useful for recordings that will take a very long time; see <a href="../Recording_movies/Record_to_bitmaps.htm">Record to bitmaps</a>.
<dt>Queue to job control
<dd>If this box is checked, pressing "Start" adds the movie to the <a href="../Job_control/Job_control.htm">job queue</a> instead of beginning the recording immediately.
<dt>Swap
<dd>Press this button to exchange the start and end points. This is useful for trying a movie in reverse.
<dt>Close
<dd>Press this button to save your changes and dismiss the dialog without starting the recording.
<dt>Start
<dd>Press this button to save your changes and begin recording.
