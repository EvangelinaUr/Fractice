<h3>Recording</h3>

<p>Fractice can record movies of your explorations. A movie is defined by a start point, an end point, and a duration. Fractice <em>interpolates</em> the data between the two points, such that the viewer travels from the start point to the end point at a constant speed. The speed is determined by both the distance between the points, and the duration. To increase the speed, choose points that are further apart, or decrease the duration.

<p>Interpolation can occur in all three coordinates (X, Y, and Z), however beginners are encouraged to interpolate in Z only. When interpolating in X and/or Y, the points must be <a href="../Recording_movies/Choosing_points.htm">chosen</a> carefully to avoid crossing large empty spaces, which would result in a boring movie. To interpolate in Z only, choose the end point first; then use <span class="cmd">Image/Zoom Out</span> to zoom out as far as desired without changing the X/Y position, and make the resulting image the start point. If zooming out in steps is too time-consuming, you can set Z directly, using <span class="cmd">Edit/Coordinates</span>.
