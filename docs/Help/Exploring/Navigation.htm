<h3>Navigation</h3>

<p>Fractice provides three navigation tools: Marquee, Hand, and Zoom. To select one of these tools, use <span class="cmd">Edit/Tool</span>, or the corresponding Toolbar buttons, or the shortcut keys <span class="key">M</span>, <span class="key">H</span>, and <span class="key">Z</span>.

<tr><th>Tool</th><th>Action</th><th>Usage</th>

<td>Marquee</td><td>Zooms into a rectanglar area.</td><td>Identify an area of interest. Left-click a corner of this area, and while holding down the left button, move the cursor to the area's diagonally opposite corner. The selected area is indicated by a dotted border (the marquee). Release the left button to render this area. To cancel the operation, press <span class="key">Esc</span> before releasing the left button.</td>
</tr><tr>
<tr><td>Hand</td><td>Drags the image in X/Y.</td><td>Left-click a point, and while holding down the left button, move the cursor. The image follows the cursor. Release the left button to render at the new coordinates.</td>
</tr><tr>
<tr><td>Zoom</td><td>Zooms continuously in or out.</td><td>Hold down the left button to zoom in; hold down the right button to zoom out. The zoom origin is determined by the cursor position. The zoom rate can be changed, via <a href="../Options/Zoom_tool_step.htm">Zoom tool step</a> in the Options dialog.</td>
