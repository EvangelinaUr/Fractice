<h3>Image Size</h3>

<p>This <a href="../Parameters/Parameters.htm">parameter</a> sets the actual size of the image, in pixels. The image is not necessarily displayed at this size; see <a href="../Exploring/Fit_in_Window.htm">fit in window</a>. Larger sizes improve the image, at the expense of increased rendering time. To change image size, do one of the following:

<ul>
<li>Select <span class="cmd">Image/Image Size</span> in the main menu.
<li>Right-click the image and select <span class="cmd">Image Size</span> in the context menu.
<li>Edit Image Width and Image Height in the Parameters bar.
</ul>

<p>The Image Size submenu includes standard sizes, a Custom option, and your most recently used non-standard sizes. Choosing Custom displays the Image Size dialog, allowing a non-standard size to be entered.

<p>You can also use the following shortcuts to select a standard size:

<ul>
<li><span class="key">Ctrl+1</span> for 320 x 240
<li><span class="key">Ctrl+2</span> for 640 x 480
<li><span class="key">Ctrl+3</span> for 800 x 600
<li><span class="key">Ctrl+4</span> for 1024 x 768
</ul>

<p>Very large image sizes can potentially exceed available memory, degrading performance. To avoid this, use the <a href="../Exporting_images/Posters.htm">poster</a> option instead. The current image allocates four bytes per pixel for escape times, and three bytes per pixel for color values, so Image Bytes = Width &times; Height &times; 7 (approximately).
