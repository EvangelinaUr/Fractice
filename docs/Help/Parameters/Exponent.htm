<h3>Exponent</h3>

<p>This <a href="../Parameters/Parameters.htm">parameter</a> sets the exponent for the Mandelbrot set, in order to support cubic, quartic, and other higher-exponent variants. Instead of the classic equation:

<p>Z = Z<sup>2</sup> + C

<p>in which the exponent of Z is a constant, the exponent becomes a variable, so that the equation is:

<p>Z = Z<sup>N</sup> + C

<p>where N is a positive integer from 2 to 13. Higher exponents give the Mandelbrot more "bulbs"; the number of bulbs equals the exponent minus one. To change the exponent, edit its value in the Parameters bar. Note that higher exponents take longer to render, due to the increased number of computations.
