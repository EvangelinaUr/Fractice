<p>Please note that this documentation is a work in progress. Many features of Fractice are not yet documented, or are documented only partially or even incorrectly in some cases. The Fractice web site is updated more often than the application's help file, so for the latest version, consult the <a href="http://fractice.sourceforge.net/helpframe.html">online documentation</a>.
