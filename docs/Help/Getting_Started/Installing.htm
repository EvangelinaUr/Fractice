<h3>Installing</h3>

<p><b>Installing for the first time:</b>

<p>Fractice is distributed as a .zip file. Unzip the distribution file, using WinZip or an equivalent program, and then double-click on Fractice.msi to launch the installer. The installer is about as simple as an installer can be: just keep hitting "Next."

<p>Note that by default, Fractice is installed for the current user only. This means additional users must manually create desktop and start menu shortcuts to Fractice. If you wish to install Fractice for all users, select the "Everyone" radio button in the lower-left corner of the Select Installation Folder page.

<p><b>Upgrading a previous installation:</b>

<ol>
<li>Unzip the distribution file to a folder, if you haven't already.
<li>In that folder, double-click Upgrade.bat to launch the installer.
<li>In the installer, select the "Repair" option and press "Finish".
</ol>

<p>Note that simply double-clicking the new Fractice.msi doesn't work. You will get the error message "Another version of the product is already installed."
